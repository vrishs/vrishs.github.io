   <p>We will be looking at relevent data to see how the world is progressing as concerns grow about the pace at which the climate worsens </p> 
   <p>I have used different datasets to track progress in key areas. Factors to consider include renewable energy production, CO2 emissions, health effects, investment in green sources, adoption of greener transport. </p>
   <P>For most of the charts the same ten countries are used to maintain consistency. These countries were selected due to their differing characteristics such as GDP, emissions and growth prospects.</P>

    <h3>CHART 1 - % of electricity generated by renewable sources globally</h3>
   </div>
   <hr>  
   <p>The map below illustrates the percentage of electricity each country has generated from renewable sources in the last 26 years.</p>
   <p>By the use of the slider for all years, it is visually clear to see a gradual positive change in a high proportion of renewable sources being used.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to see Nepal's 100% rate with Norway, Iceland and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as key contenders.</p>

    <h3>CHART 2 - CO2 Emissions by G20 Countries </h3>
  </div>
  <hr>  

  <p>Conversely, this chart provides an annual overview of the carbon footprint per capita from the G20 nations over the last 3 decades. </p>
  <p>By the use of the line chart for each nation on one canvas, it is easier to identify trends in CO2 emissions.</p>
  <p>More economically developed countries have falling rates of CO2 emissions in comparison to economically developing countries such as India, China and Turkey </p>
  <p>This data was procured by using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qx6Cfn5I_HrQ8hbgRpb6hSCt8_20fUU0?authuser=1">APIs</a> from the World Bank database which I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rTWBqBA-JVyDN3a3VG_HF82VHx5jDthc?authuser=1">merged</a> into one JSON file. </p>

  <p>The regression coefficient is 0.79, which indicates strong correlation between higher death rates at higher pollution levels.</p>

  <hr>  
  <p>Electric cars have arisen as a strong solution to combat global warming due to its aim to reduce fossil fuel consumption.</p>
  <p>The chart using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SVw6eVem7XKzIxIpEqQzqVFZTies--us?authuser=1">machine learning</a> shows the valuation changes for Polestar, Ford, Tesla, Li Auto, Lucid Motors. </p>
  <p>We can see that these are volatile companies due to their infancy. However, the data before 2022 shows fairly positive returns forecasting greater innovation in the sector.</p>

  <P>Norway has consistently been the flagbearer of the EV market as it rose from 6% to 86% in 8 years. Their EV subsidisation scheme was a key factor for this success</P>

    <h3>CHART 6 - What % of primary electricity is produced by Oil</h3>
  </div>
  <hr>  

  <P>This chart visualises what proportion of each selected country's electricity is produced by oil.</P>
  <p>Norway has been the most consistent country in terms of utilising renewable energy whether it be for transportation modes or power generation.</p>
  <P>Norway had the smallest proportion until recently when Iceland became the country using least oil to generate power.</P>
  <p>Iceland made the most significant drop from 74% to 12% within the last half century. </p>

  <hr>  
  <P>This chart visualises what proportion of each selected country's electricity is produced by hydro.</P>
  <p>Norway again has been the most consistent country in terms of generating power cleanly and efficiently.</p>
  <P>Norway generated around 70% of power from hydro sources, which plays a significant role in charging their vast EV sector.</P>
  <p>Yet again, Iceland made the most significant rise from 23% to 61% within the last half century. </p>

    <h3>CHART 8 - Investment in renewable sources</h3>
  </div>
  <p> I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NcSP0Yf753VlZYrYcvOb1oNnC_eZmLRs?authuser=1#scrollTo=zhWzT9SPQf5T">Python</a> 
    to scrape the PDF file of this study by <a href="https://www.ren21.net/gsr-2020/tables/table_22/table_22/">REN21 </a> 
    to show how much investment there has been over a decade in renewable sources. </p>
    <P>Investment in solar and wind energy dominate other sources of renewable energy such as geothermal and biofuels. </P>
    <P>This may be due to the accessibiity to the windy and sunny climates. These two sources are also amongst the most researched and developed in recent times</P>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>My main aim with this project was to delve into the progress that is being made my countries on global warming. I wanted to see how bad emissions are currently, how they are improving, and how countries are innovating to improve their carbon footprint</p>
  <p>I saw progress being made, progress such as renewable energy as a percentage of all energy increasing globally, lower COPD deaths as less CO2 emissions are further ruining health prospects. I found out how prevalent electric cars are in Europe, especially in Norway.</p>
<p>A key area where I saw needs improving is the rate of progress for increasing renewable power generation as for electric cars to be truly sustainable, we must power them with renewable energy.
 There is increasing investment in different sources which shows that countries are heading in the right direction</p>
